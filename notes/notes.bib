  year={2009},
  abstract={This work stresses the importance of the choice of the set of reference functions in the generalized multichannel quantum defect theory to analyse the location and the width of a Feshbach resonance occurring in collisional cross-sections. This is illustrated on the photoassociation of cold rubidium atom pairs, which is also modelled using the mapped Fourier grid Hamiltonian method combined with an optical potential. The specificity of the present example lies in a high density of quasi-bound states (closed channel) interacting with a dissociation continuum (open channel). We demonstrate that the optimization of the reference functions leads to quantum defects with a weak energy dependence across the relevant energy threshold. The main result of our paper is that the agreement between both theoretical approaches is achieved only if optimized reference functions are used.}

  title={Parametrisation of resonance structures in the multichannel quantum defect theory},
  journal=JPB,
  volume={20},
  number={15},
  pages={3645},
  year={1987},
  abstract={The resonance structures corresponding to autoionising states interacting with many continua are parametrised using the multichannel quantum defect theory. All the involved continua are taken into account in an effective way, and collisional parameters which describe the position and width of the resonances are then introduced. The interactions between open and closed channels are parametrised in an original way in terms of vectors whose relative orientation allows stabilisation effects to be described. The introduction of a unitary transformation which rotates the 'degenerate' closed channels greatly simplifies the analysis. This theory is well adapted to the case of core-excited Rydberg states of barium, as is briefly discussed.}

  abstract={Translations of the scales of the Lu-Fano plots are introduced phenomenologically to bring out the symmetry of two-channel coupling. These shifts in the ( nu i ) space amount to a phase renormalisation of the Coulomb basis wavefunctions of QDT, which eliminates the diagonal elements of Seaton's reactance matrix. The off-diagonal element of the resulting matrix measures the effective coupling strength and the new origins of the Lu-Fano plot axes mark the extrema of channel admixture. In the continuous energy range, the parameters ( mu i , xi ) provide a compact expression of the cross section for any two-channel (one open and one closed) process, including the whole series of resonances due to the discrete states in the closed channel. A similar generalisation of the Beutler-Fano resonance formula has been previously achieved by Dubau and Seaton (1984).}

Phenomenological analysis by MQDT readily describes a complex spectral effect in terms of a few parameters when the effect is confined to a narrow spectral band. Each parameter represents the aggregate influence of many physical factors. The authors illustrate the procedure by fitting a simple analytical expression to a localised perturbation in the Ba spectrum, and analysing the significance of each parameter.}

Direct and reactive effects of channel coupling are separated and the implications of the earlier resonance treatment are reviewed.}

  abstract={In previous work, Saraph, Seaton and Shemming have calculated cross sections for electron impact excitation of the O 2+ ground configuration terms, in the approximation of neglecting collisional coupling to configurations other than 2s 2 2p 2 . In the present work it is shown that collisional coupling with 2s2p 3 produces resonances of the type 2s2p 3 3s in the near-threshold cross sections. Calculations are made using semi-empirical methods. Radial functions are calculated using a statistical-model potential, and the binding energy of the 3s electron in the state 2s2p 3 ( 5 S)3s 4 S is calculated allowing for configuration interaction with 2s2p 3 ( 3 S)3s 4 S and 2s 2 2p 3 4 S. A parameter in the potential is then varied so as to obtain agreement with the observed binding energy for this state. Similar calculations are then made for 2s2p 3 ( 3 D)3s 2 D allowing for configuration interaction with 2s2p 3 ( 1 D)3s 2 D and 2s 2 2p 3 2 D, and for 2s2p 3 ( 3 P)3s 2 P allowing for interaction with 2s2p 3 ( 1 P)3s 2 P and 2s 2 2p 3 2 P. It is found that the 3s 2 D state lies just above the threshold for excitation of 2s 2 2p 2 1 D, and that the 3s 2 P state lies just above the threshold for excitation of 2s 2 2p 2 1 S. A generalized reactance matrix is calculated using a variational expression, and the 2s2p 3 3s functions of the present work and the 2s 2 2p 2 k p functions obtained by Saraph, Seaton and Shemming. Resonance structures are calculated using methods of quantum defect theory. It is found that the resonances produce important modifications in the cross sections at near-threshold energies of interest for astrophysical applications.}
